Bachelor Thesis — Monte Carlo Simulation for Residential Solar in Colombia
Designed a Monte Carlo–based methodology to evaluate the financial viability of residential rooftop solar in Colombian cities. Combined irradiance and temperature time series with household energy demand and regulatory incentives to simulate cash flows, estimate NPV/TIR under uncertainty, and compare scenarios for different roof sizes and tariff paths.
